  <h3> How a small-town boy from Holmes Chapel in the UK rose to stardom.  </h3>
<p>"Harry Styles, in full Harry Edward Styles, (born February 1, 1994, Redditch, Worcestershire, England), British singer, songwriter, and actor, one of the original members of the boy band One Direction and a highly successful solo artist known for his multiple chart-topping singles and albums. Styles became a member of One Direction in 2010, when the group came together to compete on the British music competition television show The X Factor. He later embarked on a career as a solo artist and actor, with forays into fashion.</p>
<p> Styles was raised in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, England, by his parents, Anne Twist and Desmond Styles. His parents divorced when he was seven years old; thereafter, he and his elder sister, Gemma, were raised by their mother. Styles made his start in music while a student at Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School, where he was the lead singer of the band White Eskimo. In 2010, encouraged by his mother, Styles auditioned for The X Factor. For the show, he performed a rendition of “Isn’t She Lovely,” a song originally written by Stevie Wonder. After failing to advance, Styles was recalled and joined with Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, and Louis Tomlinson to compete as a group on the show. The five-member group subsequently became known as One Direction, named at the suggestion of Styles, and ultimately took third place in the final round of the competition. The group released its debut studio album, Up All Night, in 2011. Styles cowrote three songs on the album, which climbed quickly to number two on the U.K. Albums Chart and to number one on the Billboard 200. One Direction’s next four albums—Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013), Four (2014), and Made in the A.M. (2015)—were all hugely successful.</p>
<p> In 2016 Styles and the other members of One Direction decided to take a break from recording and touring, enabling Styles to pursue a solo career. That year he signed a contract with Columbia Records and launched Erksine Records, an independent record label. In 2017 he released his debut single, “Sign of the Times,” which topped the U.K. Singles Chart, and his self-titled debut album. His music became known for its combined elements of classic rock, soft rock, and pop, reflecting the many artists by which he was influenced, including the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Fleetwood Mac, Harry Nilsson, and Shania Twain.</p>
<p> In 2017 Styles made his debut as an actor, taking on the role of a British soldier during World War II in the film Dunkirk (2017); his performance received positive reviews. In 2020, a year after the release of his second solo album, Fine Line (2019), which broke U.S. sales records for a British male singer and earned him nominations for British Male Solo Artist and British Album of the Year at the 2020 BRIT Awards, Styles accepted a leading role in the film Don’t Worry Darling (2022), a psychological thriller directed by Olivia Wilde. His third solo album, Harry’s House, was released in 2022, the same year as the release of the romantic drama My Policeman, a film set in 1950s Brighton, England, in which Styles played the leading role of a gay policeman.</p>
<p>From early in his career, Styles was known for his philanthropy. He frequently donated proceeds from his concerts and tours to charities and took moments onstage to bring awareness to equal rights, gender equality, and other causes. He also promoted the slogan “Treat People with Kindness,” after which he wrote a song of the same name that appeared on Fine Line. Styles received numerous nominations and awards, among them the 2021 Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance, for his song “Watermelon Sugar,” for which he also won the 2021 BRIT Award for British Single of the Year." </p>
